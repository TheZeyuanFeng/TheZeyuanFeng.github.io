  abstract={Modern legged robot morphologies assign most of their actuated degrees of freedom (DoFâ€™s) to the limbs and
designs continue to converge to twelve DoF quadrupeds with three actuators per leg and a rigid torso often modeled as a
Single Rigid Body (SRB). This is in contrast to the animal kingdom, which provides tantalizing hints that core actuation
of a jointed torso confers substantial benefit for efficient agility. Unfortunately, the limited specific power of available
actuators continues to hamper roboticists efforts to capitalize on this bio-inspiration. This paper presents the initial steps in
a comparative study of the costs and benefits associated with a traditionally neglected torso degree of freedom: a twisting
spine. We use trajectory optimization to explore how a one-DoF, axially twisting spine might help or hinder a set of axially-active
(twisting) behaviors: trots, sudden turns while bounding, and parkour-style wall jumps. Optimizing for minimum electrical
energy or average power, intuitive cost functions for robots, we avoid hand-tuning the behaviors and explore the activation
of the spine. Initial evidence suggests that for lower energy behaviors the spine increases the electrical energy required
when compared to the rigid torso, but for higher energy runs the spine trends toward having no effect or reducing the
electrical work. These results support future, more bio-inspired versions of the spine with inherent stiffness or dampening built
into the mechanical design of the spine.},

  title={An Adaptive Position Keeping Algorithm For Autonomous Sailboats}, 
  abstract={Autonomous sailboats are potential solutions for in-situ ocean measurement thanks to their high energy efficiency. Indeed, the ability for them to maintain their position is crucial for ocean data collection. Previous study has demonstrated a position keeping method for an autonomous sailboat and has theoretically proved the stability. As this method is ineffective against wind disturbance, we propose a more feasible algorithm for real environment in this paper. A retrofitted model sailboat is developed to evaluate the performance of our approach in an artificial wind field. Simulation and experiment results under several different cases show that our proposed algorithm is robust.},
